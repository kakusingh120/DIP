## 🔬 Experiment 1: RGB to Grayscale, RGB Planes, BW

### 📌 Objective

To process a given color image using:
- **1a:** Convert RGB image to **Grayscale** (3 logic methods)
- **1b:** Extract and display **Red, Green, and Blue planes**
- **1c:** Convert RGB image to **Black and White** using thresholding
